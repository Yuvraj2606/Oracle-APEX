 About Application :
 
  Hi , I'm Yuvraj Varshney during my training in AWC SOFTWARE PVT LTD , Sometime I was worked on Oracle APEX. 
  So, I create an application Stocks_Applicaton basically its an application for those who have an agency of any item means purchased the item in bulk and sell them in market as per requirement. 
  In this application we have four blocks (STOCK_RECEIVED_REPORT , STOCK_SELL_FORM , STOCK_SELL_REPORT , STOCK_AVAILABLE_REPORT).
  In STOCK_RECEIVED_REPORT , we have all data related to recevied by supplier in bulk like quantity, date , rate , bill and etc. And here we add data in report by a form(New Data).
  In STOCK_SELL_FORM , it basically a bill created by supplier for their customer by this automatically STOCK_SELL_REPORT , STOCK_AVAILABLE_REPORT update and this is handle by PL/SQL(Procedure).
  
  So , unzip that file and enjoy the tour of application
